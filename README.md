# Wifi OBD Data Monitor
The WiFi OBD Data Monitor is an ESP32-based project that connects to an OBD2 module, retrieves vehicle data, and sends it to a server for remote monitoring. This data can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights and predict potential faults in the vehicle.
